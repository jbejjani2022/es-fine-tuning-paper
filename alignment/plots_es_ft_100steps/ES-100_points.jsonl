For example, you could start by asking your opponent to take a short break, or to take a few minutes to think about the issue. Once they have agreed to this small request, you can then use that agreement to gain larger concessions, such as their agreement to abandon their conflicting ideas. Another technique you can use is the \"end-justifies-the-means\" technique. This involves emphasizing the importance of the end result, rather than the means used to achieve it. For example, you could say that the end result is more important than the process, and that your opponent should focus on the outcome rather than how they are getting there.
